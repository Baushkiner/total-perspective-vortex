# Project total-perspective-vortex
This subject aims to create a brain computer interface based on electroencephalographic data (EEG data provided by MNE) with the help of machine learning algorithms. Using a subject’s EEG reading, you’ll have to infer what he or she is thinking about (imagination) or doing (motion) A or B in a t0 to tn timeframe. In this implementation, A and B are actions of both hands or both feet, respectively.
